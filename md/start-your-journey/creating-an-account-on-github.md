# Creating an account on GitHub

Create a personal account to get started with GitHub.

## About your personal account on GitHub

To get started with GitHub, you'll need to create a free personal account and verify your email address.

You can also authenticate with Google or Apple - which are the supported social login providers when you create your account on GitHub. For iOS users, even if you have enabled the setting "Hide My Email address" for your Apple account, using social login will result in creating a new GitHub account.

Every person who uses GitHub signs in to a user account. Your user account is your identify on GitHub and has a username and profile. For example, see [@octocat's profile](@octocat).

Later, you can explore the different types of accounts that GitHub offers, and decide if you need abiling plan. For more information, see [Types of GitHub accounts](https://docs.github.com/en/) and [GitHub's plans](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/githubs-plans).

Note that the steps in this article don't apply to Enterprise Managed Users. If your GitHub account has been created for you by your company, you can skip this article and continue to [Hello World](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world).

## Signing up for a new personal account

1. Navigate to https://github.com/.
2. Click **Sign up**.
3. Alternatively, click on **Continue with Google** to sign up using social login.
4. Follow the prompts to create your personal account.

During sign up, you'll be asked to verify your email address. Without a verify email address, you won't be able to complete some basic GitHub tasks, such as creating a repository.

Some enterprises create managed user accounts for their users. You can't sign up for a personal account with an email address that's already verified for a managed user account.

If you're having problems verifying your email address, there are some troubleshooting steps you can take. For more information, see [Verifying your email address](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-github/signing-up-for-github/verifying-your-email-address).
