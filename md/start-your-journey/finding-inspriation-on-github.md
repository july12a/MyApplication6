# Finding inspriation on GitHub

You can find inspiration for your own projects and learning og GitHub and connect with a community.

## Introduction

GitHub is a vast open-source community. You can explore GitHub to find interesting repositories, topics, code, people, and organizations that can inspire your own work, or supports your own learning.

Once you've found something that interests you, you can:

* **Star** the repository or topic, so you can easily find it again later.
* **Follow** people or organizations, so you can stay updated on their activities.
* **Download** useful repositories or code, and customize it for your own use.
* **Contribute** to another user's project, by opening a pull request.

Once you star repositories or follow people, you will see updates on their activities on your [personal dashboard](https://github.com/dashboard).
