# Finding inspriation on GitHub

Once you've found something that interests you, you can:

* **Follow** people or organizations, so you can stay updated on their activities.
* **Download** useful repositories or code, and customize it for your own use.
* **Contribute** to another user's project, by opening a pull request.

Once you star repositories or follow people, you will see updates on their activities on your [personal dashboard](https://github.com/dashboard).
